Simulation Environment for Radiotherapy Applications

This version of SERA is based on the Sera 1C1 release with changes to
only include code that can be open sourced.

WARNING:

SERA was last tested over a decade ago with 32 bit machines and the
compilers at the time. SERA also has had changes to remove previous
versions of xmgr and libnurb from brlcad as the previous versions
could not be distributed as open source. Use with current compilers
has not been tested.

This repository is not being developed.
Check the forks https://github.com/IdahoLabUnsupported/SERA/forks
and the forked repository https://github.com/jrincayc/SERA
for possible new development.

Some compiling documentation is available in:
sera1/Readme.build and sera1/ImakeREADME

The user manual is:
