To upload this web site to esus you MUST do the following
to make the cgi scripts work properly and for security:

1) The directory ~/sera1/Docs/Manuals is the bnct website.
   Tar this directory and ftp is to esus.

2) Untar it on esus.

   > tar xfv Manuals.tar

3) Backup the old www on esus directory or remove it:
   
   > mv www www_old

4) Rename the Manuals directory to www:

   > mv Manuals www
   
5) Change into the www directory and rename sera1 to manual:

   > cd www
   > mv sera1 manual

6) Run the install script in the www directory:

   > ./install


NOTES:
------

The data files for the cgi scripts are only on esus and are kept in
~bnct/secure/data.

The binaries for upload are also on esus and are kept in
~bnct/secure/bin

Links to these directorys are made when the install directory is run.

Our "secure" areas and files are not completely secure.  This is because
the nature of cgi-scripting.  To be able to write to files via cgi-scripts,
the files need to be world writable.  I have attempted to hide the files
as much as possible, but am looking into better methods to secure our files.
