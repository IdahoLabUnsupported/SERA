<p><b><font size=+2>Summary</font></b>
<p><b>SERA is a suite of command line or interactively cross-launched software
modules for developing Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) patient treatment
plans.&nbsp; One of SERA's main functions is to provide a graphical environment
for constructing&nbsp; and displaying uniform volume-element-based solid
models derived from medical images.&nbsp; These solid models form the geometric
basis of the BNCT target areas for the BNCT radiation transport model.&nbsp;
Additionally, SERA provides the environment for executing the radiation
transport calculation and displaying the results of that calculation.</b>
<p><b>INEEL is initially only providing full support on a limited number
of systems with 24-bit graphics capabilities in order to best support viewing,
manipulating, and sampling three-dimensional models of imaged anatomical
features.&nbsp; Check the URL <a href="http://www.cs.montana.edu/~bnct">http://www.cs.montana.edu/~bnct</a>
for a current list of actively supported systems. Images are accepted in
a&nbsp; number of different formats, including raw 8-bit, dicom3,&nbsp;
Qsh, and other formats. The Qsh format is used as a the Sera internal image
format.&nbsp; Tools are supplied to convert the various image formats to
Qsh.&nbsp; Various image processing and surface and volume rendering tools
are also supplied.</b>
<p><b>SERA can be interactively driven, and the interface is based on the
portable X11 window environment with the Motif tool kit and the OpenGL
graphics libraries.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>License Requirements</font></b>
<p><b>The use of SERA will require a contractual agreement with the Idaho
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory for the composite software
system.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Acknowledgements</font></b>
<p><b>As with many large endeavors such as this, there is a supporting
cast of thousands lurking behind the scenes who go not only unrewarded
but, worse, unrecognized.&nbsp; In many of these cases, these same people
may and do make contributions more significant than do the authors appearing
on that work.&nbsp; This effort is no exception.&nbsp; With regard to this
effort, there is one such person that stands above all others, authors
included, and that person is Merle Griebenow.&nbsp; Merle instituted the
BNCT program at INEEL, and perhaps revived it in many other quarters.&nbsp;
Merle, like Professor Hatanaka before him, was regarded as a heretic by
many of his peers, except by those who really know him.&nbsp; We might
say that being regarded as a heretic is perhaps really an honor, since,
from the historic perspective, it's probably heresy, not necessity, that
is the mother of invention.</b>
<p><b>Merle has an incredible capacity to observe and learn and then trust
and support the people he recruits.&nbsp; For that, we are most grateful.</b>
<p><b>After Merle, we are deeply indebted to Dave Nigg, Jim Venhuizen,
and Peggy Shiffer of the INEEL BNCT program office, and Denbigh Starkey,
Computer Science Department Head at Montana State University, who have
the unenviable and difficult position of leading interference for us, while
we had the less difficult task of writing software.&nbsp; To the list of
supporters above, we would certainly be remiss if we didn't give special
recognition to Pat Gavin, Ron Dorn, Lowell Miller, Arlene Ackermann, Carol
Atkinson and Greg Storr.&nbsp; <font color="#274342">Also, a great of deal
of thanks is due to the true victims of this software,&nbsp; A.Z. Diaz
and Ruimei Ma of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Jacek Capala of Studsvik
Medical in Sweden.&nbsp; Through their diligent and expert use of this
software, Drs. Capala, Diaz, and Ma provided us with many insightful suggestions
that ultimately added significant improvement to this software. Without
the support of some outstanding students at Montana State University, including
Mike Frandsen, Cory Albright, John Evans and Jeremy Cook, much of this
work would not have been possible.</font></b>

<p><b>We would like to dedicate this effort to all BNCT candidates, patients,
and their families.</b>
