<p><b><font color="#274342"><font size=+2>2. Concepts and Notations</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">The basic concepts used by SERA are slices,
bodies, and body-slices, as illustrated in Figure 2.1.&nbsp; A slice is
data corresponding to a single medical image.&nbsp; Typically, several
anatomical features of interest will intersect a slice.&nbsp; For example,
a slice can contain a cranial object, tumor object, and objects defining
eyes, sinuses, and other relevant features.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#274342">Figure 2.1: Basic SERA Concepts</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">Bodies correspond to anatomical features from
the image (such as the skull, brain, eyes).&nbsp; Body-slices are intersections
of bodies (physical features) with slices (a medical image).&nbsp; They
are defined by drawing, filling, or painting the body on the slice.&nbsp;
Once defined, body definitions in different slices are combined to form
three-dimensional volumes.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">Typically, the user begins by displaying an
image (slice), and then defining the objects on that image which represent
body-slices (see <a href="sec05.html">Section
5</a>).&nbsp; Body-slices can then be copied to new slices, and modified
to correspond with the shapes in each new slice.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">After several body-slices have been defined,
they may be reconstructed (or synthesized) into a body representing an
anatomical feature. These reconstructions can be displayed in a three-dimensional
viewing window, where viewing controls allow arbitrary views of the reconstructed
data.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="2.1"></a><b><font color="#274342"><font size=+1>2.1 Window
Objects</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">When the program is running, there are a number
of different types of window objects which appear on the screen.&nbsp;
The graphics interface is based on the X11 window environment <a href="sec15.html#3">[3]</a>
, the Motif interface toolkit <a href="sec15.html#4">[4]</a>,
and the OpenGL three-dimensional graphics system <a href="sec15.html#5">[5]</a>.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">As shown in Figure 2.2, there are several components
in a windows environment.</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Buttons - the beginning of all operations in SERA.&nbsp;
The main SERA menu consists of a single column or row of buttons.&nbsp;
Buttons may also be the terminus of a menu selection as well as the means
of cancelling a selection.&nbsp; To "press" a button, move the mouse cursor
into the objects area and press a mouse button.&nbsp; In some cases, any
mouse button will do; in others, different mouse buttons have different
effects.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Menus - sets of buttons representing the choice
available to the user.&nbsp; Menus may be arranged either horizontally
or vertically.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Pulldown Menus - submenus that appear when a menu
button is selected.&nbsp; These menus exist only until a selection is made
or a mouse button is pressed outside of the menu.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Popup Menus - transient menus that appear unattached
to any other menu and disappear after a specific action is taken.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Input/Output Windows - for error messages, feedback,
and any typed entries that are required from the user.&nbsp; The user may
enter strings in the input regions of these windows by positioning the
cursor in the region and depressing the left mouse button which activates
the region.&nbsp; After entering the appropriate text with the keyboard,
the user will either press the ENTER key, or select the appropriate button,
such as "OK".</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#274342">Graphics Windows - windows containing graphical
representations of the data being studied.&nbsp; There are two kinds:&nbsp;
image windows, which contain a medical image slice and in which objects
identifying&nbsp; important features are drawn and filled or painted, and
viewing windows, in which 2D and 3D representations of the reconstructed
geometries are displayed.</font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font color="#274342">Throughout this manual, the terms window and widget
will be used interchangeably, to the chagrin of the purists.&nbsp; A window
is a framed view of the virtual computer display, while a widget is a combined
set of window objects, such as a viewing window and several buttons.</font></b>

<p><a NAME="2.2"></a><b><font color="#274342"><font size=+1>2.2 Input</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">SERA input devices are the keyboard, which
is used for textual input, and the mouse, which is used for both pointing
and selection by maneuvering the mouse pointer about the screen and clicking
the mouse button to indicate desired actions.&nbsp; The meaning of the
mouse clicks and key strokes depends upon their context.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#274342">In a menu, the left mouse button selects an
item from the menu to indicate what operation is to be performed.&nbsp;
At other times, the keyboard can be used to generate strings in the active
window.&nbsp; The program prompts for the type of input expected.</font></b>
