<H3><U>1B1 to 1B3 module updates to SERA 1B0:</U></H3>
After the 1B0 release the following problems were found with the
following modules:
<BR>       

<UL><U>simplot.1B1:</U>
This update fixes a long-standing bug in the dose-depth plot utility, 
which caused simplot to fail when it reached end-of-file.

<BR> 

<U>seraMC.1B7:</U>
This update increases the allowed tally grid from 30x30x30 to
120x120x120.  Also, fixes some hidden bugs related to this,
which were disguised by the use of 1cc voxels.
<B>USERS SHOULD EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WITH THIS NEW OPTION!!</B>

<BR>  

<U>seraCalc.1B3:</U>
This update makes modifications to seraCalc to accomodate the new tally
grid limits in seraMC.  It also "improves" the Kill functionality.

<BR> 

<U>seraPlan.1B4:</U>
This update makes modifications to accomodate the expanded tally grid,
and fixes associated hidden bugs (again, disguised by use of 1cc voxels).
Also, this update fixes a bug in the dose interpolation routine, which
caused improper handling of all dose components when one component had a
neighboring voxel with a zero dose value.

<U>SeraModel and Sera3d:</U> A problem was discovered in SeraModel
and Sera3d relating to slice orientations different than Transverse.
In SeraModel, with a slice orientation other than Transverse, the
bounding boxes for regions were not being computed correctly when
being saved to the .uvh file. In Sera3d, the axes were being labelled
incorrectly when a slice orientation other than Transverse was supplied
in the .uvh file. A help file has been included to describe how the
slice orientations are determined. This file should be downloaded
into the $SERA_HOME/Resources/SeraModel directory. When placed here,
it will be viewable when specifying the slice orientation in SeraModel
by pressing the "Help" button. The new version file should also be
downloaded and placed in the $SERA_HOME/Resources/Shared directory.

<U>Sera3d and SeraDose:</U> A problem was found during the reading
of the 3D dose contour header file (.chd). This problem applied
to both sera3d and seraDose. The problem occured when the number of
planes specified in the .chd file did not match the number of image
slices from the QSH data. The user is now warned if this condition
occurs, and they must correct their .chd file before continuing.

<UL>
<U>SeraMC and SeraPlan:</U> The edit isotope identifiers and atom 
densities for the new activity edits
in seraMC were not being written to the .rst file(s) created by seraMC.
As seraPlan was expecting this information, all combinations and edits
performed by seraPlan using .rst files generated by seraMC version 1B0
were incorrect - the resulting edits returned garbage.

No multiple field irradiation plans were possible using the entire 1B0
path. However, pre-1B0 .rst files from seraMC (1A0, 1A1, etc.) would produce
correct results in seraPlan combinations and edits.  All edits generated
by seraMC would be correct in 1B0.

<U>SeraModel:</U> This update fixes problems when loading QSH files
which contain both image locations and reference location/image spacing.
Prior to this fix, the reference location/image spacing was taking precedence
over the image locations.  Now, the user can use the image locations given
in the .qhd file or use the reference location
and image spacing, update the image locations, and then use these locations
in seraModel.
