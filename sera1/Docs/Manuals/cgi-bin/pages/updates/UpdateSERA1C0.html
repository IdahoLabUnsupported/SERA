<H3><U>SERA 1C0 Release:</U></H3>
We hope this is the final official release for SERA. Binaries can no longer be downloaded individually. Because of problems encountered with the various RedHat distributions regarding the Motif and Mesa (GL) libraries, the Linux distribution is only available as a full tar archive for the Redhat 8.0 release. If you have an earlier RedHat version you will need to upgrade to 8.0 or newer. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE HAVE FOUND RUNTIME ERRORS IN THE REDHAT 7.3 BINARY DISTRIBUTION WHICH WERE CAUSED BY THE GNU FORTRAN OPTIMIZER.
