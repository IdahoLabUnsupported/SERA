Sera Model
__________________________________________________

After the image information has been prepared,
image editing is usually the next step in the 
treatment planning process.

The purpose of the seraModel module is to more
easily and rapidly break an image set into regions 
of interest. The image matrix used for display in 
this program has been generalized to work on 
systems with different color depths, view images 
at an arbitrary zoom level, in an arbitrary window 
size, and with an arbitrary number of columns.

The image editor provides many useful image 
operations including manual and automatic definition 
and generation of univel-based regions of interest 
which form the geometry used by the Monte Carlo 
radiation transport simulation. Various image 
processing tools are provided to aid in the manual 
definition of these regions including region
copying, scaling, overwriting, and painting by fill 
or borders. Threshold-based segmenting, 3D region 
growing, body copying, and automatic target 
definition operations are also provided.
