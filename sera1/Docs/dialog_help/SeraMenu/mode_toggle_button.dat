Advanced Mode
__________________________________________________

Executing a program with the "Advanced Mode" 
button checked allows you to specify several
options.  The display on which the program will
run can be specified, as well as any command-line
parameters that you could normally use with the 
program.

Before specifying a display, make sure that
you have access to it.
