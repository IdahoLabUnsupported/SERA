Sera Image
__________________________________________________

Most of the treatment plans developed with SERA 
will begin with the seraImage. Its basic function 
is to convert the original image format into the 
QSH format which is the internal format used 
within the SERA modules.

The image formatting function will accept 
unformatted(raw) and dicom images. It will also 
allow the user to edit images already in the QSH 
format. Images may be deleted, image header 
information may be changed, and the images may be 
translated or rotated.
