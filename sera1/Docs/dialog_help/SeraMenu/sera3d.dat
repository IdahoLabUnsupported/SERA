Sera 3D
__________________________________________________

After all of the bodies are created with seraModel,
the three dimensional viewer provides flexible 
three dimensional displays of the univel-based 
solid models and isodose contour data. Points/lines, 
solid volume elements, or hollow volume elements 
can be used to view the geometry. Two clipping 
planes in the three orthogonal directions are 
provided. The images used to define the regions
in the image editing step may be inlaid into the 
viewing window via the texture map. The beam line 
and selected particles may also be displayed in the 
viewing window. A very unique feature for viewing 
two and three dimensional isodose contours is 
also provided.
