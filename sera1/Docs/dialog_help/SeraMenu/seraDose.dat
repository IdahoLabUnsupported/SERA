Sera Dose
__________________________________________________

The SERA Dose contouring utility function contours, 
registers, and displays two dimensional isodose 
curves superimposed over the original image set. It
will also display user selectable dose components 
and allows for dose component editing. Sera Dose 
allows for user specified contour levels and will 
report contour values at the current cursor location.
Isodose contours can be represented either as lines 
or color washed regions. A unique dose masking 
feature is provided to remove unwanted dose curves.
