Gamma repair input widget

       __________________________________________________

The gamma repair input widget allows the user to specify the gamma
repair factor for each field (values are limited to the range 0 to 1)
for the dose combination.  These values are used to weight the gamma
dose during the combination, and are used to account for the body's
natural, rapid repair of low-LET radiation damage.
