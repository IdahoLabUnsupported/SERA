Active button

       __________________________________________________

The active button for each field allows the user to activate
(the default) or inactivate any field or combination of fields
from the dose combination.  All input data is retained during
the inactivation.  Inactive fields are not included in the
dose combination calculations, or the fraction and plan summary 
computations.
