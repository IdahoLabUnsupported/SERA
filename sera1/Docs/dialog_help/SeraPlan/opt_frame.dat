Reference dose type

       __________________________________________________

The reference dose type allows the user to select the dose
component used to determine the reference location, and,
thus, the reference dose.  The reference location is the
center of the voxel containing the peak value of the
selected dose component.

The reference dose type is selected from the following:
total dose, thermal flux, or gamma dose.
