Patient ID

       __________________________________________________

The patient ID text widget allows the user to set and display
any character string (without embedded blanks) to identify
the treatment plan.  The patient ID is used as the base for
the filenames in which the plan data and combined doses are
saved.  A maximum of 50 characters are allowed.
