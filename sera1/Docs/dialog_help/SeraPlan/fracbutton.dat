Same Fields Button

       __________________________________________________

The Same Fields button provides a convenience function to the user.
When the button is toggled on (default), the .rst file names entered
in the fields for any one fraction will propogate to all other fractions
which have the button toggled on.  Toggling the button off allows
unique .rst file names to be entered for one or more fractions.
