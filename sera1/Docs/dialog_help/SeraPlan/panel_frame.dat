Plan Name and Patient ID

       __________________________________________________

Plan Name

The plan name is actually a prefix for all the files generated
by the edit module.  This must be provided for each edit run.

       __________________________________________________

Patient ID

The patient ID serves as a separator for the line edits in the
.lin file.  This is an optional parameter, and may be an arbitrary
string, containing no spaces.
