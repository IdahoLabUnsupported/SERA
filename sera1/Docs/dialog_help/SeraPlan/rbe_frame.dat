Reference RBE Values

       __________________________________________________

These are the RBE values for the various dose components
to be used for the reference dose determination, and only
the reference dose determination.  The dose components are:

   - B10       - boron dose
   - Gamma     - gamma dose
   - N14       - nitrogen dose
   - H         - fast kerma
   - Recoil    - proton recoil dose (for ultrafast only)
   - Other     - dose from reactions with other nuclides
   - Ultrafast - dose from reactions at over 20MeV with
                 other nuclides
