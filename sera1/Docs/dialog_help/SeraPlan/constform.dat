SERA Plan Combination Utility

       __________________________________________________

The Plan Combination Utility is an interactive tool to perform statistical
combination of dose results for multiple fields into a single weighted plan.
It requires a series of .rst files, containing the dose results from each
individual irradiation field, with boron levels, exposures, and gamma repair
factors for each field.  Boron levels and exposures are given in arbitrary units.

The utility generates a final weighted .rst file, containing the dose
results for the combined fields.  The weighted dose results are
normalized to 1 ppm boron and 1 unit of exposure.
