seraMC dose file name (.rst file)

       __________________________________________________

The seraMC dose file name widgets allow the user to specify the
.rst files to be used for each field in the dose combination.
The file names may be either typed in directly, or found by
traversing the directory structures using the FSB spawned by
the attached arrow button.  In either case, full path names for
the files should be provided, as this allows the combination to
be reproduced more easily.
