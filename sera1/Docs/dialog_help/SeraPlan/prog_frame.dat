Reference dose input parameters

       __________________________________________________

B10 (ppm)

The reference boron level, in ppm, to be used to determine
the reference dose for the volume search.  This values will
be used at all points.

       __________________________________________________

Regions

The regions to be included in the volume search for the
reference dose location.  This is a space- or
return-delimited list of body names, with the union of
all specified bodies used for the search.  All other
regions will be ignored.

       __________________________________________________

Location

The (x,y,z) location, given as a space-delimited triplet,
to use for the reference dose when the Point option is
selected.  The boron level will correspond to the region
at that location, but the reference RBE values defined
by the user will be applied.
