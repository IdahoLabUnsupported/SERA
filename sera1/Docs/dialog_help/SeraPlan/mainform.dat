SeraPlan

       __________________________________________________

SeraPlan is an interactive tool to perform statistical combination
of dose results for multiple fields into a single weighted plan,
and then perform various dose edits with the combined field data.
It serves as a bridge utility between the SeraCalc/SeraMC transport
module, and the SeraDose and SeraPlot dose display modules.
