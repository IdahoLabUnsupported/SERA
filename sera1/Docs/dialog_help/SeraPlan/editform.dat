SeraPlan Edit Module

       __________________________________________________

The Edit Module is an interactive tool to perform various edits
of dose results from the Combination Utility, or directly from
SeraMC.  Among the edits that may be performed are point, line,
contour, and dose-volume histogram edits.  Boron concentrations
in tissue and RBE and compound factors may be taken into account.
A large number of standard edits (DV histograms for all defined
bodies, point edits for all target points, etc.) relieve the
user of the need to interact extensively with the code.

A comprehensive list of the standard edits follows below.

   - point edits at the target points for each field
   - point edits at all defined constraint markers
   - line edits along the beam line for each field
   - contour edits on all defined image planes
   - dose-volume histograms for each defined body

In addition, standard dose-volume histogram edits for body
combinations may be defined with the Preferences file, and
these are edits are also automatically performed.
