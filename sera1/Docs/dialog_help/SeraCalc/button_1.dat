The Reconstruct Body option generates the three dimensional geometries of the treatment targets by combining (synthesizing) the objects created in the image slices.  The menu options are:

Reconstruction Window
   Used to display and manipulate the reconstructed geometries.  The widget is a complex of devices which includes a drawing area for the display, a list of the objects being displayed and sliders to control the rotation, translation, and scaling of the display.  

Render/Reconstruction Options
   Allows the user to adjust the mesh size and to assign the display colors of each reconstructed object in the Reconstruction View Window.
