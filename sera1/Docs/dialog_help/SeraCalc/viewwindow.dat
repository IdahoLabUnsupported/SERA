The Reconstruct Body field allows a three-dimensional view of the bodies defined in the image slices to be produced.  The Reconstruction View Window is used to create, display, and manipulate the reconstructed geometries.  The window is a complex of devices which includes a drawing area for the display, a list of the object being displayed and sliders to control the rotation, translation and scaling of the display and a menu.
