Edit Directives

Edit directives for the input file are entered in the large text region of the rtt_MC window.  An edit directive is chosen from the directives popup that appears.  Then, the Edit Directives "Add" button is pressed.  The edit directives are interpreted after the transport runs are completed when a 'D' mode run is specified.  These edit directives may be passive (setting variables etc.) or active (specifying that a particular type of edit be performed).  When an active edit directive is encountered during the rtt_MC run, the code performs the edit. After the active edit directive line, the user may change the variables and perform as many additional edits as desired. When the user selects the edit, a line is added to the edit window showing the number and type of input words required as well as some defaults. In general, the user will change these values to those required for this problem. When a protocol is established, many of the edit directives are very similar and those loaded from a previous case may need only slight modification for the current case. All entries are cleared when the Edit Directives Clear button is pressed. Pressing the Add button causes the popup to appear.  

   The user can press as many of these directive buttons as desired before pressing the Close button to put the popup away. As each button is pressed, the appropriate edit directive template is entered into the text widget. The user can then use standard editing techniques to put the desired values in the specific directive.
