Files Panel:

This is the set of fields in the region in the upper left quadrant of the rtt_MC interface.  These files include the input file (e.g. rtt.input), geometry files (both for analytical geometric bodies and the free-form geometry from image reconstructions if present), calculated flux and dose files (.rst suffix), the source descriptioin (e.g. rtt_source), materials descriptions (e.g. rtt_005.mat), nuclear cross sections (rtt_005.sigma) and the version of the rtt_MC code (e.g. rtt_MC_105).Each of these selections consists of a push button with a label and a text entry field to the right of the button. Entering a value can be performed using one of two methods. The first method consists of the user selecting the text entry field by moving the cursor to the area and clicking the left mouse button. The value for the field is entered using the keyboard. The second method consists of pressing the button with the label. A file selection popup appears and the user can select the name of an existing file. Upon pressing the OK button of the file selection popup, the name chosen is entered into the text entry field.
