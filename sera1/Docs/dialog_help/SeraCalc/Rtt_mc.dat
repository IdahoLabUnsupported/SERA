   The Rtt_mc function can be used for transport modeling.  One may build a new rtt_MC input file from scratch or one may open an existing input file which can be modified as desired to produce an updated input file.  The input can then be tested and run this interface.  The detailed input description for the components are described in the rtt_MC user's manual.  

   The title for the rtt_MC run is entered in the field at the top of the panel labeled "Run Title."  This identifies the particular data set.
