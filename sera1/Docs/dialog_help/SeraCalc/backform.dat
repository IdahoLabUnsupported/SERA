   The Slice Viewer provides access to the tools that control the visual appearance of the slice and, most importantly, the ability to create body slices.  
   The far right column of the Slice Viewer contains windows listing "Local Bodies," "All Bodies," and "Z Values."  By clicking the left mouse button on a particular z-value in the list, the corresponding image will be centered in the Slice viewers. 
   The Slice Viewer has various buttons located at the bottom of the window that provide convenience features used in body slice construction.  
   Note:  The "Done" button is used to comple control point entries for a particular body and trigger the computation of the spline curve for that body.
