The Apply button should be selected after making all necessary adjustments to the Field of View, Scaling, and Translations.  After selecting "Apply," you will be prompted to enter a file name.  The file name is used to generate two rtt_MC interface file names.  The first file generated will have the .rs suffix and will contain all of hte objects in the reconstruction.  The second file will have the .rm suffix and will contain the correspondence between the region_in code, the region_in name, the material in the region name, the region_out code and the body capping switches.  These two files are written to the same directory where the executable image of BNCT_Rtpe was invoked or to the directory containing the original slices.
