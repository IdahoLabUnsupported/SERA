When saving this file, you may set new values for the field of view, change the scaling, and translate the image.  Leaving the scaling at the default values of unity does not scale the image.  Values less than one shrink the image in the X, Y, or Z axes, while values greater than one can be used to expand the image in any of these directions.  The images can also be shifted by setting the translate values to non-zero.

After filling in the desired values, press the "Apply" button.
