The Nurbs

    	  The nurbs are a smooth-surface representation
    	of a mesh of control pts.  
    	The nurb control panel allows the user to control
    	four main areas of the nurb properties, the order,
    	the quality, how the control points are sampled,
    	and whether the nurb is rendered as mesh or solid.
      	________________________________________________

    	Order:

         The three orders of the nurb are Linear, 
       Quadratic, and Cubic.  The Linear option 
       actually connects the control points into
       flat polygons.  The Quadratic and Cubic both
       approximate the control points making a smooth
       surface.  The Cubic gives a smoother surface 
       than the Quadratic, but with the expense of 
       varying a little farther from the control
       points.
      	________________________________________________

	Quality:

          The quality of the nurb can be Low, Medium,
       	or High.  What this means is the number of 
       	sampled points in between the control points.
       	The High quality has a larger number of polygons
       	producing a better quality nurb.
      	________________________________________________

    	Sampling:

   	  Currently there are two methods or algorithms
      	for sampling control points.  The first method 
      	is the Direct Method.  The Direct Method breaks
      	the current points for a given body (and slice)
      	up into sections, each containing the same number
      	of points.  Then a control point is chosen from
      	each section.  The point that is chosen is the 
      	"odd" point, or in other words the point that 
      	varies the most from the others.  When there is
      	a long stretch of points that are contained in a 
      	small section, the Direct Method will tend to 
      	conform into that area, resulting in large and
      	deep stretch marks on the whole nurb.  This 
      	problem can be avoided with the Degree Method.
      	The Degree Method also divides the bodies points
      	into groups, but here the groups do not have an
      	equal number of points.  The groups represent 
      	equal degree intervals around a circle. Then
      	again from the groups, the odd point out is
      	chosen.  Because only one control point comes
      	out of a group, the long stretch of points in 
      	a small region will not produce many control 
      	control points like in the Direct Method. This 
      	ultimately results in a smoother nurb surface.

	Nurb Type:

  	  The nurb type is simply how the nurb is to 
      	be rendered, as a Mesh, or as a Solid surface.
      	________________________________________________

	Number of Control Points:

	  This menu controls how many sampled control 
	points will be taken from the region outlines
	in the construction of the nurbs.
      	________________________________________________

	Draw Control Points:

	  This option will display the selection control
	points from the regions as spheres to see how the
	control points are being selected.

 	"Rebuild Nurbs" button -
       
          After the settings have been modified, the 
     	Nurbs must be rebuild to the new specifications.
     	This button will rebuild and redisplay the nurbs.
