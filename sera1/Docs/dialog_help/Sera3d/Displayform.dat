The Main Rendering Window:

    This area is an OpenGL specific drawing area. 
	

    Controls:
         After right-clicking on the main drawing area, 
         a "Mouse Control" menu appears.  The options 
         in this menu are : 
	       
         Pull Axis -
             This option displays the X,Y,Z axis in the 
             image each with two colored spheres on the 
             ends.  The colored spheres on the end of an 
             axis correspond to the colors of the other 
             two axis.  By holding down the mouse button 
             on a sphere, the rotation will be around that 
             colored axis. Then, dragging the axis with the 
             mouse button down will rotated the image around 
             the axis.

         Sliders -
             This option brings up the X,Y,Z rotational 
             sliders to the bottom of the main Drawing area.  
             Rotating by these will rotate the image the 
             corresponding amount between 0 and 360 degrees.

         Mouse Buttons -
             The mouse buttons used are button 1 and 
             button 2.  Holding down button 1 and moving 
             in the y direction (up and down) will rotate 
             the image around the x_axis.  Holding down 
             button 2 and moving the mouse in the x direction 
             (right and left) will rotate the image around 
             the z_axis.
	
    Double-Buffered:
         It is a double-buffered drawing area, which 
         means that when an image is being drawn, it 
         is drawn into a "back" buffer, hidden from 
         the viewer.  As soon as the image is drawn,
         it is move to the front buffer.  This allows 
         a smooth animation for simpler images.
