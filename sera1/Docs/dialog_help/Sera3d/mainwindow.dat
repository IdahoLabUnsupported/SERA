Sera3D

	________________________________________________

      Sera3D is an interactive viewing tool to visualize 
    the newly adopted univel files for the BNCT project.  
    The program requires a univel file (.uv) and its 
    corresponding univel header file (.uvh).  
   
      Sera3D extracts the size and spacing info from the
    uvh file, then extract the univels from the univel 
    file.  The univel information can then be visualized 
    in 3D in a variety of viewing forms.

   Viewing Forms:
      The viewing forms that are currently available are 
      Points, Lines, Voxels, Nurb Mesh, and Nurb Filled.  

      Points :
           This is the default viewing form.  It takes 
           the univel information and draws an outline 
           of points for each body, and for each slice.  
           This gives the 3d image a "ringed" appearance 
           where the "rings" are the outlines of the
           bodies. 

      Lines : 
           This viewing form is very close to the Points 
           form.  With this method, the points are simply 
           connected with lines, which results in a bolder 
           outline of the bodies.

      Voxels : 
           Viewing the univel information as voxels is 
           the most representative of what the univels 
           look like.  Due to the larger number of polygons 
           in this mode, the rendering speed is greatly 
           slowed.  The voxels are actually tall rectangular 
           cubes, their height based on the spacing
           between the slices.  

      Nurb Mesh :
           The use of nurbs to approximate the boundaries 
           of the bodies results in a smooth surface 
           wrapping.  The visual results are a more 
           life-life surface. The nurb surface is
           wrapped completely around the body, based 
           on sampled control points taken from the body 
           points. The surface is closed in the horizontal 
           direction, but stops at the control points for 
           the top and bottom slices of the defined body.  
           The nurb was not close at the top and bottom to 
           keep the surface as close to the actual univel 
           information as possible.
	   The nurbs can be rendered based on either a 
           linear, quadratic, or cubic function.  The default 
           is the quadratic which give the closest 
           approxiamation to the control points. This viewing 
           type uses the nurbs, but displayes them as a wire 
           mesh allowing the viewer to look through to the
           inner bodies.

      Nurb Filled :
           The last viewing method is the same as the 
           Nurb Mesh, only the nurb is rendered as 
           filled polygons and a smooth
           surface is the result.
