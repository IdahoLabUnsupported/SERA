	Double Buffered vs. Single Buffered

	  When in single buffered mode, the rendering 
         (drawing) is done directly to the screen, 
         allowing the user to watch the drawing process.
	  When in double buffered mode, the rendering
         (drawing) of the scene is done to a "back" 
         buffer first, then when finished it is 
         swapped to the screen during a screen refresh.
         This method provides no view of the drawing 
         process and gives a smooth animation, such
         as when rotating.

	Show Frame Rate:

	  The show frame rate toggle button toggle the
         frame rate in the bottom left corner of the
         rendering window from being drawn. The frame 
         rate is in frames per second.

	Testing the Polygon Speed
	
	  The test polygon speed button will determine 
         the rate at which your system is drawing polygons.
	  The test first draws 50,000 points, then 
         50,000 triangles, then 50,000 lit triangles
         and returns the speed results.
