Slice Controls:

	The Slice control panel provides the controls
       needed to inlaying medical slices into the rendering.

	________________________________________________
	Loading Raw Images:

	  The Load Raw Images button will bring up the 
        file selection box (fsb).  The Raw Images must
        be contained in a .qim file that corresponds to 
        the UV file which is in use.  
	  When the slices are loaded, they are stacked 
        into a 3D texture map for easier handling.

	Inlay Slice Check Box:

	  The inlay slice check box toggles a single 
         from being inlaid into the rendering.

	Slice Direction:

	  The three radio buttons control the direction
         of the inlaid slice.  Choices are the three
         orthogonal directions: Axial (IS), Coronal (PA),
	 or Sagittal (RL).
	________________________________________________
	
	External Window:

	  The external window button will toggle an
         external window in which the current inlaid 
         slice will be drawn. The external window
	 can be drawn in single or double size, and 
         will also allow beam lines to be displayed.
	  The external window will display the inlaid 
         beam slice if one is enabled.
	________________________________________________
	
	Slice Slider:

	  The slice slider controls the position of the
         currently inlaid slice.  If the current slice 
         direction is Axial the slider represents the 
         IS value, if the current slice is a coronal
         slice, the slider represents the PA value, etc.
