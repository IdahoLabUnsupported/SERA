Clipping

	Clipping allows portions of the bodies to be 
	"cut" away along a plane, allowing the bodies 
	along the "cut" to be viewed.  
     	________________________________________________

	Clipped Bodies:

	  The clipped bodies box gives a list of the
         bodies each with a check box.  If the bodies
         check box is checked, it means that the body
         WILL be clipped.  The bodies can be enabled/
         disabled from clipping at any point.
     	________________________________________________
  
	Setting the Clipping:

	  By pressing the Set Clipping button at the 
	bottom of the clipping control panel, the clipping 
	dialog appears.  
	  The clipping dialog box is fairly complex.
     	________________________________________________
	
	Interactive Clipping Toggle
		 
	First, at the top of the window is a check box
	for turning interactive clipping on and off.  
	When interactive clipping is on all changes being
	made to the clipping will be redrawn as they are
	changed.  Also when the interactive clipping is
	enabled, a second toggle button will appear below
	it.  
     	________________________________________________

	Drawing the Clipping Planes:

	  Draw clipping planes toggle will draw the
	clipping planes as large square polygons in the
	rendering window.  When Draw Clipping planes is 
	checked the planes will move, but the bodies will
	not be clipped until the "done" button is checked.
     	________________________________________________

	Direction Toggle Buttons:

	  Below the toggle buttons is the direction buttons.
	The direction buttons switch the rest of the controls
	to the current direction.
     	________________________________________________

	  Below the direction buttons is the current direction
   	box.  At the top of the box is a toggle button which
	enables the clipping planes for the current direciton.
     	________________________________________________
	
	Clipping Position labels:

	  The clipping position labels give the locations 
	of the slider settings, for the given slice 
	directions.
     	________________________________________________

	The Clipping Sliders:

	   The two sliders control the 2 clipping planes
	for the current direction.  
     	________________________________________________

	Capping:

	  When the clipping plane cuts through the bodies,
	the bodies are hollow and they are not capped.  
	Capping can be done with the medical image data,
	through the texturing process.  To cap the clipping,
	a check box below the clipping plane slider will 
	toggle the capping on and off. 

	 NOTE:  the raw images must be loaded in order
	        to utilize the capping.
      	________________________________________________

	Specific Value Clipping Box:

	  Below the sliders and capping buttons is a text
	box for entering a specific value.  Once the value
	in entered, the two buttons underneath the text box
	represent which clipping plane the entered value
	should be applied to.  By pressing the button
	the value will be applied to that clipping plane.
