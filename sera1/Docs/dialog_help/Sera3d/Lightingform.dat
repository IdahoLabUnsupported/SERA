The Lighting

     First of all, the lighting is only used when
   the view style is voxels or nurbs.  The lighting
   is used to give a must more realistic rendering
   of the data.  When the view style is only lines
   or points, the lighting is disabled, this also
   helps to keep the drawing speed up.
     There are 5 available lights to toggle.  They 
   are located at the front right, front left,
   back right, back left, and above.  These positions
   are given in reference to the viewer looking at the
   head.  The light positions are fixed, which means
   that when the object is rotated, the lights do not
   move.

   Ambient Slider:
       To control the ambient lighting, an ambient 
     slider is provided.  The value of the slider
     ranges from 0 (no ambient) to 1 (full ambient).
     Ambient values near .4 give the best results.


   Default:
       By default the front right and back left lights 
     are turned on, while the other three are turned 
     off.  The default setting for the ambient light 
     is .4 .
