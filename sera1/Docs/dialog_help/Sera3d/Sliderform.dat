The Rotational Sliders

     One of the methods of rotating the rendered 
   bodies is through the use of the sliders.  The
   sliders are toggled by right clicking on the 
   main display area to display the "Mouse Controls"
   menu and choosing "Sliders".

     Three sliders are made available for controls.  The
   sliders rotate around the X, Y and Z, axis.  To the
   right of the slider is the number of degrees for which
   the rotation will be (around the corresponding axis).
   The rotation will not be applied to the object until
   the mouse button has been release.

     NOTE:  Remember when using voxels or nurbs, the
            rendering speed is quite slow, so the
            changing of the body rotation is not 
            immediate.
