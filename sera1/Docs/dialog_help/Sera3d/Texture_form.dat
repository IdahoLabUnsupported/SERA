Texture Mapping Controls:

	The ability to inlay slices in orthogonal and arbitrary
       directions is through the use of 3D texture mapping.  The
       slices are stacked upon one another creating a "block" or 
       volume texture.  Then when a plane is drawn, it can be 
       colored or texture mapped based on its position within the
       block.  
	
      	__________________________________________________________

	When drawing the arbitrary plane through the "block"
      oF slices, determining how the slice values are mapped 
      to the plane can be done two ways:

	NEAREST: The value used to color the particular pixel 
	 of the plane is by using the nearest value from the
         "block" of slices. This provides the fastest rendering
         rates.

	LINEAR:  The value used to color the pixel in this case
	  is by linearly interpolating between the 4 nearest
	  pixel values in the "block" of slices. The rendering 
          speed is sacrificed for a smoother rendering.

	__________________________________________________________

	If the plane or object to be texture mapped partially or 
       completely lies outside of the texture map volume, determining
       how the extruding portion is colored is also done one of 
       two ways.

	REPEAT:  The texture map will repeat, the extruding portion
                will act as if it is extruding back into the texture
	        volume from the opposite side.

	CLAMP:   The texture map will be clamped to the last pixel
                of the map for all extruding portions.  If the last
                pixel is black in the texture map and a portion of
                the plane extrudes out, the portion will be drawn in
                black.

	Alpha Culling:
	  
	  Alpha Culling allows certain values of the textured 
         object to be discarded.  This is used to remove the black
	 from around the slice, so that just the slice can be 
         drawn into the scene.  The slider underneath controls 
         which values are to be discarded.  All values less than
         the slider will be discarded.

	__________________________________________________________

	Volume Rendering:
		
	  Volume Rendering is done with the texture map.  With
         alpha culling enabled, 256 planes (inlaid slices) are 
	 drawn cutting through the texture map.  The adjacent slices
         stack together rebuilding the original structure (head).
	  The direction of the slices is determined by the direction
         chosen in the slice control panel for inlaying a single 
         slice.  The only exception is when a beam slice is enabled,
	 the volume rendering will be done with beam slices.

	Texturing the Bodies:

	  The check box for texturing the bodies will toggle the
         texture map from being applied to the bodies.
