The Viewform

	  The default control panel is the viewing 
	control panel.  Starting from the top of the 
	viewing control panel and working down, the 
	controls are as follow:

	________________________________________________

	View Style :
 
	  This drop-down menu currently has 4 viewing 
	options. The viewing options are how the data is 
	to be displayed to the screen.  The options are 
	Points, Lines, Voxels, and Nurbs.
	________________________________________________

	Viewing Forms:

	  The viewing forms that are currently available 
	are Points, Lines, Voxels, Nurb Mesh, and Nurb 
	Filled.  

      	Points :
           This is the default viewing form.  It takes 
           the univel information and draws an outline 
           of points for each body, and for each slice.  
           This gives the 3d image a "ringed" appearance 
           where the "rings" are the outlines of the
           bodies. 

      	Lines : 
           This viewing form is very close to the Points 
           form.  With this method, the points are simply 
           connected with lines, which results in a bolder 
           outline of the bodies.

      	Voxels : 
           Viewing the univel information as voxels is 
           the most representative of what the univels 
           look like.  Due to the larger number of polygons 
           in this mode, the rendering speed is greatly 
           slowed.  The voxels are actually tall rectangular 
           cubes, their height base on the spacing
           between the slices.  

      	Nurbs :
           The use of nurbs to approximate the boundaries 
           of the bodies results in a smooth surface 
           wrapping.  The visual results are a more 
           life-life surface. The nurb surface is
           wrapped completely around the body, based 
           on sampled control points taken from the body 
           points. The surface is closed in the horizontal 
           direction, but stops at the control points for 
           the top and bottom slices of the defined body.  
           The nurb was not closed at the top and bottom to 
           keep the surface as close to the actual univel 
           information as possible.
	   The nurbs can be rendered based on either a 
           linear, quadratic, or cubic function.  The default 
           is the quadratic which give the closest 
           approxiamation to the control points. 
           For detailed control of the nurbs, the Nurbs
           control panel is available.
	________________________________________________  

	Scaling :

	  The next control down on the control panel is the 
	scaling slider.  The scaling slider will scale the 
	3d bodies between .5 and 2 times the actual size.  
	The slider defaults to 1.
	________________________________________________

	The View Buttons:

	  Below the scaling slider are the view buttons.  
	They allow the camera to be moved into different 
	locations, changing the view in the main window.  
	Remeber, the camera is the only thing to move when 
	the buttons are used, so the rotation to the bodies, 
	and the postitions of the lights are not modified. 
	The default camera position is in front of the bodies, 
	and slightly above.
	________________________________________________

	The Reset Button:

	  At the bottom of the viewing controls is the reset 
	button.  This button simply sets all the viewing controls 
	back to their default, exluding the viewing style.
