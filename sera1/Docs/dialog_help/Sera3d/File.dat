The File Menu

     The file menu has three options : open, close, 
   and exit.

     Open :
           The open option will bring up the file 
         selection dialog.  The files that you are
         currently allowed to select are the univel
         file (.uv),  univel header file (.uvh), or
         the gzipped univel file (.uv.gz).  
           No matter which file is selected, both a 
         univel file (uv or gz) and a univel header
         file (uvh) must be present in the same 
         directory under the same prefix.  
         When open the files are processed and the
         3d image is displayed as the default view
         stlye of points.

     Close : 
           The close option simply removes the loaded
         file from the Bnct3d application.

     Exit :
           The exit option removes the loaded file 
         (if one is loaded) and exits the Bnct3d
         program.
