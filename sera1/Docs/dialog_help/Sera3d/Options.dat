The Options Menu

    Axis Types:

	    The axis coloring is : 
                       X - Red
                       Y - Yellow
                       Z - Blue
         
         Thin Line:
	         The three positive axis (X, Y, Z) are 
               drawn as a thin line.

         Thick Line:
	         The three positive axis (X, Y, Z) are 
               drawn as a thick line.	

         Full:
	         All the positive and negative axis are
               displayed.

         Off :
                 No axis are drawn.


    Axis Labels:
	      The axis that are drawn will have its
           label drawn at its end.  For example the 
           positive X axis will have a X+, while the
           negative Z will have Z-  .

    Fast Rotation:
	      Fast Rotation is a method for allowing the
           user to rotate complex graphical objects without
           having to wait for the slow redrawing speeds.  To
           accomplish this, while the object is being rotated,
           it is drawn at a very low resolution or as a simpler
           object.  When the object is done rotating, it is 
           displayed back as the complex object.

         by Wireframe:
	      When rotating, the bodies are displayed as
           points (not really wireframe).

         by Axis:
	      When rotating, only the axis are displayed.
            NOTE:  make sure the axis are on or nothing
                   will be displayed.

         Off:
	     The original objects are displayed when 
            rotating.  

           WARNING:
                   The voxels and nurbs are slow to redraw
                 so rotating them without fast rotation 
                 does not work well.

      
    Multi-View:
        With Multi-View enabled, 3 more rendering windows are
       added to the left side of the screen.  They are camera
       positions from the left, right and top views.   Because
       the rendering has to be directed to a total of four 
       windows, the multi-view slows down the operations 
       slightly.

    Messages:
        With Messages enabled, the title bar above the main
       rendering window will post the current activity of 
       the program.  At the current time, the messages, are
       informative, but tend to slow the program slightly.
