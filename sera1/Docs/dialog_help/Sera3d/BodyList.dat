The BodyList

    The body list displays all of the body names defined
  in the uv file.  The main purpose of the body list
  is to allow the toggling on and off of the available
  bodies. 

    When a file is loaded, the names of the bodies are 
  filled in, and all are toggled to "on" (highlighted).
  By clicking on the body name, the name will
  unhighlight, and the body will not be rendered, until
  it has been re-highlighted.
