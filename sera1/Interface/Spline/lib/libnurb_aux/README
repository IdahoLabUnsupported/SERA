libnurb2_aux contains routines that I wrote to complement the libnurb
library and the bnct data structures.

surface_refinement.c :	
		Refines knot vectors to prevent subdivision past surface
		refinement.  Kind of weird, due to ARL idiosyncracy.

brl_surface_routines.c :	
		Goes through the slice list and creates whole surfaces.
		Also does capping.

file_routines.c :
		reads in slice data from a bnct data file.

memory_routines.c :
		malloc and free routines for data structures.
