This library, while small, contains the all-important surface
subdivision and ray tracing routines.

subdivision_routines.c :
	Uses recursion, Peterson's method to approximate a nurb surface
	locally with quadrilaterals.

ray_tracing_routines.c :
	traverses the bounding box heirarchy set up in
	subdivision_routines, looking for an intersection.
