 *									*
 *			Doubly-linked list support			*
 *									*
 *  These macros assume that all user-provided structures will have	*
 *  a "struct rt_list" as their first element (often named "l" [ell]).	*
 *  Thus, a pointer to the rt_list struct is a "pun" for the		*
 *  user-provided structure as well, and the pointers can be converted	*
 *  back and forth safely with type casts.				*
 *									*
 *  Furthermore, the head of the linked list is usually			*
 *  a full instance of the user-provided structure			*
 *  (although the storage-conscious programmer could make the head	*
 *  just an rt_list structure, with careful type casting).		*
 *  This makes results in a doubly-linked circular list, with the head	*
 *  having the same shape as all the list members.			*
 *  The application is free to make use of this symmetry and store	*
 *  data values in the head, or the extra storage in the head can	*
 *  be ignored.								*
 *									*
 *  Where a macro expects an argument "p", it should be a pointer to	*
 *  a user-provided structure.						*
 *									*
 *  Where a macro expects an argument "hp", it should be a pointer to	*
 *  a "struct rt_list" located in the list head, e.g., &(head.l).	*
 *									*
 *  Where a macro expects an argument "old", "new", or "cur", it should	*
 *  be a pointer to the "struct rt_list" located either			*
 *  in a user-provided structure, e.g. &((p)->l),			*
 *  or for the case of "old" it may also be in the list head, e.g.	*
 *	RT_LIST_INSERT( &(head.l), &((p)->l) );				*
 *									*
 *  Dequeueing the head of a list is a valid and			*
 *  well defined operation which should be performed with caution.	*
 *  Unless a pointer to some other element of the list is retained	*
 *  by the application, the rest of the linked list can no longer be	*
 *  referred to.							*
 *									*
 *  The "magic" field of the list header must be set to the constant	*
 *  RT_LIST_HEAD_MAGIC, but the "magic" field of all list members	*
 *  should be established by user code, to identify the type of		*
 *  structure that the rt_list structure is embedded in.		*
 *  It is permissible for one list to contain an arbitrarily mixed	*
 *  set of user "magic" numbers, as long as the head is properly marked.*
 *									*
 *  There is a dual set of terminology used in some of the macros:	*
 *	FIRST / LAST	from the point of view of the list head		*
 *	NEXT / PREV	from the point of view of a list member		*
 *	forw / back	the actual pointer names			*
 *									*
