known problems

  1) some of the neutron kerma's (from MACLIB) are wrong (e.g. N-14)
      wrote program tkerm.f to generate thermal (Gp 71-94) kerma's
      for Li6(510), N14(513), B10(521), CL(541), and K(542)

     updated rttlib_build.in for these isotopes and set thermal kerma's
     to 0.0 for AL(509), Li7(511), and NA(525). Also adjusted kerma's
     in epithermal region for Cl.

note: MACLIB IV includes decay heat in kerma's. This is not appropriate
      and is why I zeroed the thermal kerma's except for Li6,B10,N14,Cl

Regenerated library rtt_002.sigma
  checked plots and everything was identical the new KERMA's and they
  looked better. We do need to improve them however

  problem when very low cross sections are being plotted. plot.f
  doesn't write to plot file when sigma is less than sigmin but
  plot routine draws line between points, not showing drop in
  cross section. Could tell plot routine to move instead of draw

  see lib_hist for notes on library evolution
