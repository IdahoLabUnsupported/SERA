# This file contains a list of bodies that might be found
# in a spline file.  The list is meant to be in the order
# of containment.  For example, since 'scalp' comes before
# 'tumor', 'tumor' would be found inside of 'scalp'
#
# If seraConvert has asked you add a body to this list,
# please put it in the 'most logical' place.
