The axes convention used within SERA is as follows:
---------------------------------------------------

The principal axes are the Inferior to Superior (IS) 
axis, the Posterior to Anterior axis (PA), and the Right
to Left (RL) axis. These axes are always with respect to
the patient, for example the patient's right or left.
Superior is always above inferior and anterior is always
in front of posterior. We have combined a (+/-) suffix 
to the axes labels which provide a direction to the axis
in order to properly describe the slice orientation with
respect to the pixel and slice ordering.

In seraModel the image origin is located in the upper
left hand corner of the image so that the columns
increase left to right with respect to the image and the
row pixels increase top to bottom. The convention we 
have adopted for the three major slice orientations is 
described as follows:

Axial, Transverse, or Transaxial Images
=======================================
For the standard set of axial images with the image face
or nose corresponding to the top of the image the PA 
axis is labeled as PA- since the pixels increase from
top to bottom. The IS axis is IS+ if the slice locations
increase from the bottom of the patient. The RL axis is
RL+ if the the patient's right side is on the viewer's
left.

Coronal Images
==============
In the case where the viewer is looking at the face of
the patient the IS axis is labeled IS- since again the
rows increase from top to bottom of image. The RL axis
would then be labeled as RL+ and the PA axis would be
labeled as PA+ if the slices increased from back to
front of patient.

Sagittal Images
===============
If the face or nose of the patient points to the left
side of the image the PA axis is labeled PA- since
the pixels increase left to right of the image (not the
patient). The IS axis would be labeled as IS- if the top
of the head corresponds to the top of the image. The RL
axis would be RL+ if the slices increase from the
patients right.
